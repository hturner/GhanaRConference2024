## What is Quarto?

> ### Quarto^®^ is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

. . .

> You can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more.

## Sounds like R Markdown!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/rmarkdown_wizards.png)

## R Markdown Mechanics

![](images/rmd-knitr.png)

## So why Quarto?

> Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown. For **everyone**.

. . .

> Quarto is a command line interface (CLI) that renders plain text formats (`.qmd`, `.rmd`, `.md`) OR mixed formats (`.ipynb`/Jupyter notebook) into static PDF/Word/HTML reports, books, websites, presentations and more

## Quarto can be used like R Markdown

![](images/qmd-knitr.png)

## But is more general

-   Code can be R, Python, Julia, Observable JS

-   `knitr` and `jupyter` engines

-   Works in RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code

. . .

In this talk, we'll focus on R and RStudio

## One install, "Batteries included"

R Markdown grew into a large ecosystem of packages, with **varying syntax**.

. . .

Quarto comes **"batteries included"** straight out of the box

-   HTML reports and websites
-   PDF reports
-   Word documents
-   Presentations (Powerpoint, Beamer, `revealjs`)
-   Books

. . .

-   Any language, *exact* same approach and syntax

::: notes
all in one versus separate packages
:::

## Do I need to switch?

R Markdown will continue to be maintained.

Even if you only use R, there are reasons to switch

-   Better accessibility and richer features built in
-   Development now focused on Quarto for new features
-   Potential to collaborate with non R-users

See [FAQs](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html), including a conversion from RMarkdown formats to Quarto equivalents.

## Quarto Documents

> A Quarto document i.e. a `.qmd` is a plain text file, like a `.rmd`, that can be rendered to many different formats

```         
---
title: "Introduction to Quarto"
format: html
---

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.
```

## Anatomy of a Quarto document

-   Metadata (YAML)

``` yaml
---
title: "Introduction to Quarto"
format: html
---
```

## Anatomy of a Quarto document

-   Text

``` markdown
## Section Header

This is a sentence with some **bold text** and some *italic text* 
This is an [image](image.png).
```

## Anatomy of a Quarto document

-   Code

```{{r}}
1 + 1
```

::: notes

## Rendering a Quarto document

1.  Install Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>

2.  Open a new, empty Quarto document in RStudio

![](images/clipboard-3061132192.png)

##  {#quarto-document-dialog .center-h data-menu-title="Quarto document dialog"}

![](images/clipboard-1574562795.png){style="\"max-width=100%"}

##  {#new-quarto-document-visual .center-h data-menu-title="New Quarto document - visual"}

![](images/clipboard-1752499319.png){style="\"max-width=100%"}

##  {#new-quarto-document-source .center-h data-menu-title="New Quarto document - source"}

![](images/clipboard-2673774451.png){style="\"max-width=100%"}

##  {#demo-html-output .center-h data-menu-title="Demo HTML output"}

![](images/clipboard-3563194863.png)

## Metadata: YAML

"Yet Another Markup Language" or "YAML Ain't Markup Language"

``` yaml
---
key: value
---
```

The [YAML](https://yaml.org/) metadata or header is:

> processed in many stages of the rendering process and can influence the final document in many different ways. It is placed at the very beginning of the document and is read by each of Pandoc, Quarto and `knitr`. Along the way, the information that it contains can affect the code, content, and the rendering process.

## Output Options

``` yaml
---
format: something
---
```

. . .

``` yaml
---
format: html
---
```

``` yaml
---
format: docx
---
```

``` yaml
---
format: revealjs
---
```

## Options on options

Then add option arguments!

``` yaml
---
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
    code-fold: true
---
```

. . .

Sub-options should be below the main format output and spacing matters!

``` yaml
---
format: 
  html:
    option1: text
    option2: logical
---
```

## YAML is sensitive

``` yaml
---
format:html # invalid, no space between
---

---
format: # invalid, read as missing
html
---

---
format: 
  html: # valid but needs next object
---
```

## Text: Markdown

> Markdown is a plain text format that is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly, easy to read

. . .

> Quarto is based on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL#pandocs-markdown) and uses its variation of markdown as its underlying document syntax.

## Links

-   There are several types of "links" or hyperlinks.

::: panel-tabset
## Markdown

``` markdown
You can embed [named hyperlinks](https://quarto.org/),
direct urls like <https://quarto.org/>, and links to 
[other places](#quarto-anatomy) in 
the document. The syntax is similar for embedding an
image: ![Ghana R logo](images/ghana-r.jpg).
```

## Output

You can embed [named hyperlinks](https://quarto.org/), direct urls like <https://quarto.org/>, and links to [other places](#quarto-anatomy) in the document. The syntax is similar for embedding an inline image:\
![Ghana R logo](images/ghana-r.jpg){style="width:250px;"}
:::

## Tables

There are various ways to create tables, e.g. this *pipe table*

```         
| Default | Right | Left | Center |
|---------|------:|:-----|:------:|
| 12      | 12    | 12   | 12     |
| 123     | 123   | 123  | 123    |
| 1       | 1     | 1    | 1      |
```

produces

| Default | Right | Left | Center |
|---------|------:|:-----|:------:|
| 12      |    12 | 12   |   12   |
| 123     |   123 | 123  |  123   |
| 1       |     1 | 1    |   1    |

```{{r}}
#| label: distinct-cyl
#| echo: false
mtcars %>% 
  distinct(cyl)
```

-   Has 3x backticks on each end ```` ``` ````\
-   Indicate engine (`r`) between curly braces `{r}`\
-   Place options underneath, behind the `#|` (hashpipe):
    -   `#| option1: value`

## Figure with code

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| fig-alt: A scatterplot of ozone level against temparature, with a local regression fit that has a confidence band. The ozone level is fairly constant at around 15ppb from a temperature of 55°F to 75°F, then increases linearly to around 80ppb at a temperature of 90°F, where the ozone level starts to asymptote. The points are generally close to this curve apart from 7 outliers with higher than expected ozone between 75°F and 95°F.
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

## Output

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| fig-alt: A scatterplot of ozone level against temparature, with a local regression fit that has a confidence band.

#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
:::

## Table with code

Simple tables can be created with `knitr::kable()`

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-airquality
#| tbl-cap: "Biochemical oxygen demand over time."
#| tbl-colwidths: [40,60]
library(knitr)
BOD |>
  kable(align = "cr")
```

## Output

```{r}
#| label: tbl-airquality
#| tbl-cap: "Biochemical oxygen demand over time."
#| tbl-colwidths: [40,60]
library(knitr)
BOD |>
  kable(align = "cr")
